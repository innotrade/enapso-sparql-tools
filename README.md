# enapso-sparql
Generic node package to generate and transform sparql queries.

This package is SPARQL 1.1 compliant. Hence, it is designed to run on all SPARQL 1.1 compliant databases. 
**The following demos use the Enapso GraphDB client. Therefore, these examples require a running GraphDB 8.x instance on localhost at port 7200. The demos as well as the automated tests require a fully working Ontotext GraphDB repository "Test" and a user "Test" with the password "Test" being set up, which has read/write access to the "Test" Repository.**

**This project is actively developed and maintained.**
